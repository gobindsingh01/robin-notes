            Computer Organization includes how a computer is organized or to put it simply how all the components of computers are made and how they are working.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Assembly Language is a computer language that is close to computers than other computer languages.
        </li>

    <li><b>High level </b> language is closer to the human</li>
    <li><b>Low level</b> language is closer to the machine.</li>
</ul>
    <p>
        The first thing introduced to the student is <b>VON NEUMANN ARCHITECTURE</b>. what is it? lets find out.

                VON NEUMANN ARCHITECTURE is a graphical representation (diagram) of computer components and how they connect. 
            </li>
            <img src="https://cdn-cfpof.nitrocdn.com/BlsuvUouCRMZXlRDnoReLQfXZdugMQtC/assets/images/optimized/rev-4a0537b/teachcomputerscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4.1-Von-Neumann-and-Harvard-architectures-1024x574.png" height="300px" alt="VON NEUMANN ARCHITECTURE image" >
            <li>As we can see in the above diagram, the architecture consists of 3 parts :
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Input Device</b> : helps in taking inputs , examples - keyboard, mouse, touch screen, microphone, etc.</li>

                    <li><b>Processing Unit</b> : also called as CPU (central processing unit) helps in processing the input data and give the output back to user.This is also called as brain of computer as this is where all the working happens and everything is connected to this brain.</li>

                    <li><b>Output Device</b> : helps in giving output back to user , examples - monitor, speakers, projectors, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            Now that we know the basics, lets move a little step deeper. let's see control unit ,
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Control Unit</b> : helps controlling the flow of the data, think of it as a component which takes data from input and work on the data appropriately and then send it back to the output device.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Arithmetic and Logic unit</b> : 
                <br>
                <b><i>Arithmetic unit</i></b> helps in doing mathematical work on the input and produce the output. example -> +,-,/,etc.
                <br>
                <b><i>Logic unit</i></b> helps in working on logical work. example - >, <, >=, <=,etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
